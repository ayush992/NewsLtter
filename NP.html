                As AI technology advances, it’s natural to feel a sense of hesitation or even concern about the potential impacts.
                AI is rightly touted as a massively powerful tool, with the power to transform the way that businesses operate and even force societies to ask critical questions about ethics, privacy, and the nature of humanity.
                But more immediately, you may be wondering: will AI take over my job?
                Robots and automation systems have indeed eliminated many jobs already. 
                Since 2000, about 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have disappeared as their tasks have become automated. 
                Still, the growth of AI likely means more than just a shift from humans to machines in the workplace. 
                It is forecast that AI could create jobs as well—97 million of them by 2025.
                AI is more likely to lead to a reduction in available jobs in some industries than others. Senior tech executives from the
                Forbes Technology Council have identified over a dozen jobs and industries that are likely to become fully (or almost fully) automated in the next decade.
                These include manufacturing and warehouse positions, long haul trucking, research and data entry, customer service, and some insurance jobs, among others. 
                These categories comprise millions of jobs across the country, as well as both specially trained employees and blue-collar workers.

            <h4>ChatGPT-maker OpenAI planning to launch app store for AI software</h4>
            <div class="content">

                   OpenAI, creator of the widely popular chatbot ChatGPT, plans to launch a marketplace that will allow developers to sell their AI models built on top of its own AI technology, tech publication The Information reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of discussions at the company.
                   Enterprise customers using ChatGPT often tailor the technology to their specific uses, which range from identifying financial fraud from online transaction data to answering questions about specific markets based on internal documents. According to the news report, makers of such models could offer them to other businesses through OpenAI's proposed marketplace.
                   OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman disclosed the potential plans during a meeting with developers in London last month, the report said.
                   Such a marketplace could compete with app stores run by some of the company's customers and technology partners - including Salesforce and Microsoft - and help OpenAI's technology reach a broader customer base.
                   OpenAI did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
                   The Information also reported that two of the company's customers, Aquant, which makes software that manufacturers use to guide customers through device maintenance and repairs, and education app maker Khan Academy, might be interested in offering their ChatGPT-powered AI models on OpenAI's marketplace.

                            On 2 June 2023, three trains collided in Balasore district, in the state of Odisha in eastern India. The Coromandel Express entered the passing loop instead of the main line near Bahanaga Bazar railway station at full speed and collided with a goods train. Due to the high speed of the Coromandel Express, its 21 coaches derailed and three of those collided with the oncoming SMVT Bengaluru–Howrah Superfast Express on the adjacent track.
                            A total of 292 people were killed in the crash and 1,175[4] others were injured. It was India's deadliest railway crash since the Firozabad rail collision in 1995, although the Gaisal train collision in 1999 may have killed more people. It was also the deadliest rail disaster worldwide since the 2004 Sri Lanka tsunami train wreck.[5][6]
                            On 2 June 2023, the 12841 Coromandel Express was travelling from Shalimar in Howrah, West Bengal, to MGR Chennai Central in Chennai, Tamil Nadu on the up main line at the Bahanaga Bazar railway station. Around the same time, the 12864 Bengaluru–Howrah Express was travelling in the opposite direction from SMVT Bengaluru in Bangalore, Karnataka, to Howrah on the adjacent down main line. Both trains, not scheduled to stop at the railway station and having received a green signal indicating it was safe to proceed along the main line, were at their highest permitted speed of 128 km/h (80 mph).[7][8]
                            At about 19:00 IST (13:30 GMT), the Coromandel Express was supposed to continue straight on the up main line but was wrongly switched to the parallel up loop line at full speed, where it collided with a stationary goods train laden with iron ore. Because of the high impact speed, 21 coaches of the train were derailed from the main line.[7][9][10][11] The goods train did not derail or move.[7]
                            Three of the derailed coaches from the Coromandel Express careened into the adjacent track and whiplashed the tail end of the Bengaluru–Howrah Express crossing the station at the same time.[7] Two unreserved coaches and the brake van of the Bengaluru–Howrah Express were derailed. The remainder of the train, which included the engine and 20 coaches, left with its passengers and continued to Balasore, where a further damaged coach was detached. The remaining 19 coaches then continued their journey to the train's destination of Howrah. It was reported that the reserved compartments of the Bengaluru–Howrah Express sustained no passenger fatalities or injuries. Officials said that ascertaining the identification of passengers on the unreserved coaches would take time.[12]
